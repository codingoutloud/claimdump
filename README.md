# claimdump

Gathers all claims for authenticated users and dumps them out in a neat table.

ASP.NET Core version.

## How did I create this?

Created a sample program using command line:
```bash
dotnet new webapp
```
then made meaningful changes to only one file: 
https://github.com/codingoutloud/claimdump/blob/master/Pages/Index.cshtml

(and cosmetic changes to a couple of other files).

## How can I use this?
